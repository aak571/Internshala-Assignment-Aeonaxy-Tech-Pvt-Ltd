Note: As I do not have my own 'domain' I wasn't able to implement the emailing fuctionality using 'Resend'. Because Resend requires their users to verify with their domain first, which I don't have. But otherwise my project can be an astounding delight to walk-through or go through. It has all other functionality including the Email Verification page that very closely reside with the project description that was given to me by 'Aeonaxy Tech Pvt Ltd'.
